## Title: Real-time Face Detection with OpenCV

## Description:
This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library to perform real-time face detection using the webcam. The script detects faces in each frame captured by the webcam and draws rectangles around the detected faces while labeling them as "Person". It continuously displays the frames with detected faces in a window named "FACES". To exit the program, simply press the 'q' key.

## Usage:
Ensure you have OpenCV installed (pip install opencv-python).
Download the script.
Run the script.
Press 'q' to exit the program.

## Note:
This script requires access to a webcam.
The Haar Cascade classifier file haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml is used for frontal face detection and should be available in the same directory as the script.

## Enjoy real-time face detection with OpenCV!
